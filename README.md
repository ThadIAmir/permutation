# permutation
 this a python code that gives you the permutations of 1 to n without itertools .

* it's made of some nested loops and one slicing for inserting the new number into previous number's permutation to create the current number's permutations . 

* of course as i said , you could do this with -insert- , but i wanted to solve it via bottom-up method so yeah i used slicing instead of inserting .
